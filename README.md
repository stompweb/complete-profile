## About

I regularly use WordPress for building web apps. These web apps regularly require some kind of user management however because when setting up a user in the WordPress admin the first name & last name are not mandatory then usually it will use usernames for the display name. This looks scrappy when used across the site so I've created a plugin that uses Gravatar to fill in the first name, last name and display name for all users that have an account. The plugin works on activation and updates all users.
